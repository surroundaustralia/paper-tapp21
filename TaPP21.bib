OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. This document serves as an introduction to OWL 2 and the various other OWL 2 documents. It describes the syntaxes for OWL 2, the different kinds of semantics, the available profiles (sub-languages), and the relationship between OWL 1 and OWL 2.},

	abstract = {This special issue and our editorial celebrate 10 years of progress with data-intensive or scientific workflows. There have been very substantial advances in the representation of workflows and in the engineering of workflow management systems (WMS). The creation and refinement stages are now well supported, with a significant improvement in usability. Improved abstraction supports crossfertilisation between different workflow communities and consistent interpretation as WMS evolve. Through such re-engineering the WMS deliver much improved performance, significantly increased scale and sophisticated reliability mechanisms. Further improvement is anticipated from substantial advances in optimisation. We invited papers from those who have delivered these advances and selected 14 to represent today’s achievements and representative plans for future progress. This editorial introduces those contributions with an overview and categorisation of the papers. Furthermore, it elucidates responses from a survey of major workflow systems, which provides evidence of substantial progress and a structured index of related papers. We conclude with suggestions on areas where further research and development is needed and offer a vision of future research directions.},

Currently, modelling provenance in ProvONE is an arduous task and lacks an automated approach. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, called Prov2ONE that automatically generates the ProvONE prospective provenance for scientific workflows defined in BPEL4WS. The same prospective ProvONE graph is updated with the relevant retrospective provenance, preventing provenance to be captured in various non-standard provenance models and thus enabling research communities to share, compare and analyze workflows and its associated provenance. Finally, using the Prov2ONE algorithm, a ProvONE provenance graph for the nanoscopy workflow is generated.},
